# MWPMVis
A visualizer written in C++ for surface code decoding. 

### Implementation
Handles interface calls with Dear ImGui, and renders the visualization using OpenGL 3.3. 

The libraries that I used for this project (GLFW, GLEW, GLM, Dear ImGui, STB) are included in the ```\external``` directory.
